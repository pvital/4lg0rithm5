# Fibonacci

A **[Fibonacci sequence]** is an integer sequence characterized by the fact that 
each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1:

```0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...```

In some older books, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 
1 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

In mathematical terms, the sequence ```Fn``` of Fibonacci numbers is defined by 
the recurrence relation:

This source code implements in C and Python the calculation of a Fibonacci 
sequence of a given number.
