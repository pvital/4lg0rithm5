# Fibonacci

A **Fibonacci sequence** is an integer sequence characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:

By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation:
